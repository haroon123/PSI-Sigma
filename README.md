# The New PSI index
Traditionally, the PSI index is denoted as (a+b)/(a+b+2c), where a and b stand for the number of splice-junction reads connecting the alternative exon to the upstream and downstream constitutive exons, respectively (Barbosa-Morais et al. 2012). c stands for the number of junction reads connecting the two constitutive exons. We modified the PSI index as follows:
