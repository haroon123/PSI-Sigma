PSI<sub>Σ</sub>
=================
Previous single-exon PSI approaches were designed for simple splicing events with only one alternative exon, but they can be ambiguous in the case of mutually exclusive exons, multi-exon skipping, and more complex events. PSI-Sigma is using a new splicing index (PSI<sub>Σ</sub>) that is more flexible, can incoporate novel junctions, and can compute PSI values of individual exons in complex splicing events.

MANUAL
======
Generate .bam, .bai and .SJ.out files by STAR (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR). Create links to the .bam, bai, and .SJ.out files in the a folder (afolder).
```
mkdir afolder
cd afolder
ln -s bamfolder/*.bam* .
ln -s bamfolder/*.SJ.* .
```
Download a .gtf file and sort the coordinates.
```
get ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-87/gtf/homo_sapiens//Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.gtf.gz
gzip -d Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.gtf.gz
(grep "^#" Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.gtf; grep -v "^#" Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.gtf | sort -k1,1 -k4,4n) > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.sorted.gtf
rm Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.gtf
```
Create two files: (1) groupa.txt and (2) groupb.txt. The .bam files in groupa.txt will be compared with groupb.txt.
The examples here are assuming that the .bam files were generated by using short-read RNA-seq data from TCGA:
```
ls *-11A-*.bam > groupa.txt
ls *-01A-*.bam > groupb.txt
```
Run dumpai.pl and specify the folder (e.g., ~/PSIsigma) where you put the PSIsigma scripts.
Please specify 1 for short-read RNA-seq and 2 for long-read RNA-seq. The last number (3) means a minimum 3 supporting reads for an AS event.
```
#For short-read RNA-seq (minimum 3 supporting reads for an AS event)
perl ~/PSIsigma/dumpai.pl Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.sorted.gtf PSIsigma 1 3
#For long-read RNA-seq (minimum 3 supporting reads for an AS event)
perl ~/PSIsigma/dumpai.pl Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.87.sorted.gtf PSIsigma 2 3
```
That's it.
The results will be in the PSIsigma_r3_ir3.sorted.txt.
