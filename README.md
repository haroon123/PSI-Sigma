The New PSI index
=================
Previous single-exon PSI approaches were designed for simple splicing events with only one alternative exon, but they can be ambiguous in the case of mutually exclusive exons, multi-exon skipping, and more complex events. The new PSI index is flexible, can incoporate novel junctions, and can compute PSI values of individual exons in complex splicing events.
